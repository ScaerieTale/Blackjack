Okay, so it's a bit rough right now, but you can hopefully see where I'm going with it!

I'm actually a bit stuck on a bug at the moment.  I can't seem to get the logic to switch playerCanHit from true to false, letting the player click "Hit" as many times as they want.

This of course completely defeats the purpose of the game.
